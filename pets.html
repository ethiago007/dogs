        have over the years become uniquely adapted to human behaviours, hereby improving communication between the dog

        behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size and color. They
        perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the
        military,companionship,therapy and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the
        nickname "man's best friend".</p>
